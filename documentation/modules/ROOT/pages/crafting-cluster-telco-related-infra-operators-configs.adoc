= Crafting the Cluster Telco Related Infrastructure Operators Configs
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:profile: 5g-ran-lab

In the previous section, we created the infrastructure as code (IaC) for our `SNO2` cluster using the `SiteConfig` object. In this section, we are going to create the configuration as code (CaC) for our clusters by using multiple `PolicyGenTemplate` objects.

We described how `PolicyGenTemplate` works in detail xref:policygen-deepdive.adoc#policies-templating[here], so let's jump directly to the creation of the different templates.

NOTE: The configuration defined through these PolicyGenTemplate CRs is only a subset of what was described in xref:telco-related-infra-operators-intro.adoc[Introduction to Telco Related Infrastructure Operators]. This is for clarity and tailored to the lab environment. A full production environment for supporting telco 5G vRAN workloads would have additional configuration not included here, but described in detail as the {rds-link}[{openshift-release} Telco RAN Reference Design Specification] slide deck.

[#crafting-common-policies]
== Crafting Common Policies

The common policies apply to every cluster in our infrastructure that matches our binding rule. These policies are often used to configure things like CatalogSources, operator deployments, etc. that are common to all our clusters.

These configs may vary from release to release, that's why we create a `{policygen-common-file}` file. We will likely have a common configuration profile for each release we deploy.

IMPORTANT: If you check the binding rules, you see that we are targeting clusters labeled with `common: "{policygen-common-label}"` and `logicalGroup: "active"`. These labels were set in the `SiteConfig` definition in the link:crafting-deployments-iaac.html#siteconfig[previous section].

1. Create the `common` PolicyGenTemplate for {openshift-release} SNOs:

[#crafting-group-policies]
== Crafting Group Policies

The group policies apply to a group of clusters that typically have something in common, for example they are SNOs, or they have similar hardware: SR-IOV cards, number of CPUs, number of disks, etc.

The CNF team has prepared some common tuning configurations that should be applied on every SNO DU deployed with similar hardware. In this section, we will be crafting these configurations.

IMPORTANT: If you check the binding rules you can see that we are targeting clusters labeled with `group-du-sno: ""` and `logicalGroup: "active"`. These labels were set in the `SiteConfig` definition in the link:crafting-deployments-iaac.html#siteconfig[previous section].

IMPORTANT: By leveraging hub site templating we are reducing the number of policies on our hub cluster. This makes the clusters's deployment and maintenance process simpler. Notice that with large fleets of clusters, it can quickly become hard to maintain per-site configurations.

2. We're using policy templating, so we need to create a `ConfigMap` with the templating values to be used. Notice that the following resource contains values for multiple hardware specifications that we may have in our infrastructure. In the policy we have just applied we are obtaining the value for tuning our SNO by obtaining the value of the label `hardware-type` that each cluster was assigned to. This label was set in the `SiteConfig` definition in the link:crafting-deployments-iaac.html#siteconfig[previous section].

[#crafting-site-policies]
== Crafting Site Policies

Site policies apply to a specific cluster or clusters in our site. They usually configure stuff that is very specific to a single cluster or to a small subset of clusters. For example, we could configure the SR-IOV network devices for a group of clusters if those share the same number of network interfaces, NIC model, etc. otherwise we will need to have different bindings for different clusters.

We are going to create the SR-IOV network device configurations for our SNO2 cluster whose hardware type belongs to `hw-type-platform-1`. That sort of servers are built with 2 virtual Intel IGB capable SR-IOV network devices. Notice that this policy leverages hub side templating. Therefore, it is targeting all clusters with this specific hardware configuration, not only the `SNO2` cluster.

1. Create the `du-sno-sites` PolicyGenTemplate for the clusters that contain `hw-type-platform-1` hardware type in our `5glab` site. In our case the `SNO2` cluster:

2. We're using policy templating, so we have to create a `ConfigMap` with the templating values to be used. Observe that the following manifest contains SR-IOV information for each cluster deployed by our Hub-1. This network information is required to configure the SR-IOV network devices and provide SR-IOV capabilities to the Pods deployed in our SNO clusters. In the previous policy, it is captured the name of the SR-IOV interfaces (PFs) recognized on the host node to present additional virtual functions (VFs) on your OpenShift cluster. Those values are retrieved by obtaining the name of the cluster managed by the hub. The information is not obtained from a label set in the `SiteConfig` definition, it is the `ManagedClusterName`, e.g., the name of the cluster used instead.

Testing policies before applying them to our production clusters is a must, in order to do that we will create a set of testing policies (which usually will be very similar to the production ones) and these policies will target clusters labeled with `logicalGroup: "testing"`. We won't go over every file, if you check the files that will be created those are the same as in `active`, also known as `production`, but with different names and binding policies.

At this point, policies are the same as in production (active). In the future, you prior want to apply these groups of testing policies for the clusters running in your test environment before promoting changes to production (active).

[#configure-kustomization-for-policies]
== Configure Kustomization for Policies

We need to create the required kustomization files as we did for SiteConfigs. In this case, policies also require a namespace where they will be created. Therefore, we will create the required namespace and the kustomization files.

1. Policies need to live in a namespace, let's add it to the repo:

2. Create the required Kustomization files
+
WARNING: You can see that we commented the `group-du-sno-validator.yaml` files in our Kustomization files. Since this is a lab environment and we don't have PTP/SR-IOV hardware, the validator policies won't be able to verify our SNOs as a well-configured DU. We kept the files here so you know how a real environment should be configured.
