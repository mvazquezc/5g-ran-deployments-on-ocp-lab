= Using TALM to Update Clusters
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:profile: 5g-ran-lab

In this section, we will perform a platform upgrade to both managed clusters using the pre-cache and backup feature implemented in the Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM) operator. The pre-cache feature prepares the maintenance operation in the managed clusters by pulling the required artifacts prior to the upgrade. The reasoning behind this feature is that SNO spoke clusters may have limited bandwidth to the container registry, which will make it difficult for the upgrade to complete within the required time. In order to ensure the upgrade can fit within the maintenance window, the required artifacts need to be present on the spoke cluster prior to the upgrade. The idea is pre-caching all the images needed for the platform and operator upgrade on the node, so they are not pulled at upgrade time. Do it in a maintenance window(s) before the upgrade maintenance window.

The backup feature, on the other hand, implements a procedure for rapid recovery of a SNO in the event of a failed upgrade that is unrecoverable. The SNO needs to be restored to a working state with the previous version of OCP without requiring a re-provision of the application(s).

IMPORTANT: The backup feature only allows SNOs to be restored, this is not applicable to any other kind of OpenShift clusters.

Let's upgrade our both clusters. First of all, let's verify the TALM operator is running in our **hub cluster**:

Finally, let's take a look at the cluster group upgrade (CGU) CRD managed by TALM. If we pay a closer look we will notice that an already completed CGU was applied to SNO2. As we mentioned in link:talm.html#inform-policies[inform policies] section, all policies are not enforced, the user has to create the proper CGU resource to enforce them. However, when using ZTP, we want our cluster provisioned and configured automatically. This is where TALM will step through the set of created policies (inform) and will enforce them once the cluster was successfully provisioned. Therefore, the configuration stage starts without any intervention ending up with our OpenShift cluster ready to process workloads.

WARNING: It's possible that you get `UpgradeNotCompleted`, if that's the case you need to wait for the remaining policies to be applied. You can check policies status https://console-openshift-console.apps.hub.5g-deployment.lab/multicloud/governance/policies[here].

[#getting-snos-kubeconfigs]
== Getting the SNO clusters kubeconfigs

In the previous sections we have deployed the `sno2` cluster and attached the `sno1` cluster. Before we continue with TALM, let's grab the kubeconfigs for both cluster since we will need them for the next sections.

[#upgrade-policy-creation]
== Creating the upgrade PGT

Create an upgrade PGT in inform mode, as usual, that will apply and upgrade the SNOs located in Europe (binding rule: `du-zone: "europe"`), SNO1 and SNO2 clusters. This file needs to be created in the ztp-repository Git repo that we have created.

Modify the kustomization.yaml inside the site-policies folder, so it includes this new PGT and eventually will be applied by ArgoCD.

NOTE: If you're using MacOS and you're getting errors while running `sed -i` commands, make sure you are using `gsed`. If you do not have it available, please install it: `brew install gnu-sed`.

Then commit all the changes:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
cd ~/5g-deployment-lab/ztp-repository/
git add site-policies/fleet/active/{talm-update-file} site-policies/fleet/active/kustomization.yaml
git commit -m "adds upgrade policy"
git push origin main 
-----

Once committed, in a couple of minutes we will see a new policy in the multicloud RHACM console. As noticed, the policy named `europe-snos-upgrade-{talm-update-policy-name}` has a violation. However, only one cluster is not compliant. If we check the policy information we will see that this policy is only targeting SNO2 cluster. That's because the SNO1 cluster does not have the labels zone-europe and active logicalGroup that the PGT is targeting in its binding rule. 

WARNING: Notice in the following picture that there are policies not applying to any cluster. Those are policies targeting the test environment. This is expected since we do not have any clusters in the test environment, e.g, no clusters are labeled with the proper label for testing: logicalGroup=test.

Let's add the proper labels to the production cluster SNO1:

[#upgrade-cgu-creation]
== Applying the upgrade

At this point, we need to create a Cluster Group Upgrade (CGU) resource that will start the upgrade process. In our case, the process will be divided into two stages:

1. Run a pre-cache of the new OCP release prior to start the upgrade process.
2. Before running the upgrade, a backup will be done.

[#talm-backup-precache]
=== Backup and pre-cache

Let's create the CGU. In this case, we will apply the managed policy (europe-snos-upgrade-{talm-update-policy-name}) to both clusters at the same time (maxConcurrency is 2). Notice that the CGU is disabled, this is suggested if we are going to run the precaching feature. This means, that once the precaching process is done we are ready to start the upgrade process by enabling the CGU. This idea is related to the compliance of a maintenance window in an enterprise. 

Remember that several gigabytes of artifacts needs to be downloaded to the spoke for a full upgrade. SNO spoke clusters may have limited bandwidth to the hub cluster hosting the registry, which will make it difficult for the upgrade to complete within the required time. In order to ensure the upgrade can fit within the maintenance window, the required artifacts need to be present on the spoke cluster prior to the upgrade. Therefore, the process is split up into two stages as mentioned.

image::timing.png[TALM maintenance window concept]

In OCP 4.14+, there is a new CRD called `PreCachingConfig` that will allow us to be more precise on the container images that we need for our cluster to upgrade. We must apply the {talm-precachingconfig-doc}[PreCachingConfig CR] before or concurrently with the CGU to our hub cluster:

NOTE: You can obtain a more detailed list for `excludePrecachePattern` for each upgrade by following https://access.redhat.com/articles/7046378[this KCS].

Once applied, we can see that the status moved to `InProgress` with a message detailing that the precaching process is in progress for both SNOs. This means that the first step in our process is executing the pre-cache.

Moving to the Infrastructure -> Cluster section of the multicloud console we can also graphically see both clusters being upgraded:

Notice that now the upgrade policy `europe-snos-upgrade-{talm-update-policy-name}` is now compliant on both clusters. See that, in order to save resources, the enforce policy is removed once the CGU is successfully applied.
